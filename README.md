## Development environment

A system with minimum 0.5MB chip is required, and some additional fast or chip memory to host the sources. Can be a real Amiga or emulator-based.

Seka (most likely) or AsmOne is needed to assemble the source code.

## Assembly

This part is a bit more complicated as the floppies it came from had bad sectors, so some of the files are damaged. The floppy with the final version of the demo sources was not readable at all, so thiese sources come from an older one and so are most likely not the final versions. They also need some tidying up w.r.t. the includes and externs.
